description: "Using static website generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), you can use the OLRC to host your website content. Simply build your website, place your files into the OLRC, and make the content public. Your site will then be publicly accessible, without having to worry about managing a web server!"
