description: "The OLRC is an ideal place for storing archival information packages for long-term preservation. Reliable and secure storage has long been a challenge for digital preservation: content stored on a system with a single failure point is at significantly greater risk for deletion, corruption or disaster. Furthermore, storage must be economical and scalable as organizations increasingly expand digital preservation for greater amounts of digital content for the future. <br><br>

Archival packages are replicated three times across the cloud network to ensure continuous protection, and audit functions ensure that compromised or corrupted files are quarantined and with a replica from the network.<br><br>

Additional preservation processing tools such as Archivematica can be hosted on the cloud to enable effective preservation functions, such as normalization, migration, and fixity checks. Furthermore, access copies derived from originals can be stored in the cloud for use in local discovery and access systems."
