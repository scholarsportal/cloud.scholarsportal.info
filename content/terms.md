The Service is offered subject to acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein (the Terms of Use) and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site by the Service provider. The Service is available only to individuals affiliated with the Subscriber, including staff, faculty and students, as applicable (Authorized Users or Authorized User).

## Modification of Terms of Use

The Service Provider reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the Terms of Use at any time. It is the responsibility of Authorized Users to check the Terms of Use periodically for changes. Continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Terms of Use constitutes acceptance of those changes.

## Rules and Conduct

As a condition of use, Authorized Users promise not to use the Service for any purpose that is prohibited by the Terms of Use.

By way of example, and not as a limitation, Authorized Users shall not (or permit others to) either (a) take any action or (b) upload, download, post, submit or otherwise distribute or facilitate distribution of any content using any communications service or other service available on or through the Service, that:

* infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity or other right of any other person or entity;
* constitutes unauthorized or unsolicited advertising, junk or bulk e-mail (“spamming”);
* contains software viruses or any other computer codes, files, or programs that are designed or intended to disrupt, damage, limit or interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware, or telecommunications equipment or to damage or obtain unauthorized access to any system, data or other information of the Service Provider or any third party.

Additionally, Authorized Users shall not: (i) take any action that imposes or may impose (as determined by the Service Provider in its sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure managed by the Service provider; (ii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or any activities conducted on the Service; or (iii) bypass any measures the Service Provider may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service (or other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to the Service).

You shall abide by all applicable local, provincial, national and international laws and regulations.

## Registration

As a condition to using the Services, Authorized Users are required to register with the Site and select a password and login name. You shall provide the Service Provider with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of the Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your OLRC account. You shall not (i) select or use as a login name a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (ii) use as a login name a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization. The Service provider reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a login name, in its sole discretion. You are solely responsible for activity that occurs on your account and shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password.

The Service provides you with the ability to display, organize, and accept content through creating public and shared folders.

## Dispute Resolution

A printed version of the Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

## Integration and Severability

The Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and the Service Provider with respect to the Service and use of this Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and the Service Provider with respect to this Site (but excluding the use of any software which may be subject to a separate end-user license agreement). If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

The Service Provider may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms of Use, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.
